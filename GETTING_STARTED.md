## ðŸŒŸ Remember

**Start Small, Think Big**: Focus on one feature at a time. Perfect the core experience before adding complexity.

**User First**: Build what users actually need, not what you think they want. Get feedback early and often.

**Consistency**: Work on your project regularly, even if just 30 minutes a day. Small progress compounds over time.

**Authenticity**: Your unique perspective and voice are your biggest assets. Don't try to copy others.
