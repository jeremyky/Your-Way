# YourWay Psychology Assistant - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The YourWay Psychology Assistant is a RAG-powered AI system designed to support personal growth and self-reflection. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with psychology-informed coaching to provide personalized insights and guidance.

## üéØ Mission & Guard Rails

### Mission
- Help users surface patterns in mood, habits, triggers, and goals
- Offer psycho-educational tips grounded in CBT, ACT, mindfulness, and journaling
- Reference user's own notes, journal entries, and past conversations
- Support self-reflection and personal growth

### Guard Rails
- **NOT a licensed clinician** - Cannot provide diagnosis or treatment
- **Privacy-first** - All data encrypted and user-controlled
- **Crisis detection** - Automatic detection and appropriate response to crisis indicators
- **Educational focus** - Self-reflection and growth, not clinical treatment

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Privacy

### Crisis Detection
- **Automatic scanning** of all user messages
- **Keyword detection** for crisis indicators
- **Immediate response** with crisis resources
- **Professional referral** to appropriate services

### Privacy Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** of all data
- **User-controlled** data retention
- **No data sharing** with third parties
- **Local processing** where possible

### Data Security
- **Row Level Security** (RLS) in Supabase
- **User isolation** - users can only access their own data
- **Audit logging** of all interactions
- **Secure API endpoints** with authentication

## üìà Usage Examples

### Starting a Conversation
```typescript
// User types: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with work lately"
// System retrieves relevant context:
// - Past journal entries about work stress
// - Previous mood entries showing similar patterns
// - Goals related to work-life balance

// AI responds with:
// - CBT-based reframing techniques
// - Specific patterns from user's history
// - Actionable suggestions
// - Follow-up question for deeper exploration
```

### Daily Reflection
```typescript
// System generates personalized prompt:
// "I notice you've been writing about work stress in your journal. 
// Today, let's reflect on what specific aspects of work are most 
// challenging and what small changes might help."

// User responds with reflection
// System stores and analyzes for future insights
```

### Pattern Recognition
```typescript
// System identifies patterns:
// - "You tend to feel stressed on Mondays"
// - "Work-related anxiety peaks before deadlines"
// - "You feel most energized after exercise"

// Provides insights and recommendations based on patterns
```
